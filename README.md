# iSENSE-tracker

This is a program for the Adafruit Feather Huzzah ESP8266 board.

It will allow the board to retrieve data using the API of isenseproject.org.

Currently, it is very much a work in progress.

ISENSETracker object must be declared with the static storage class specifier at the top of the loop() function
